# Voltage I (10): Each combat, you will electrify all other players in range, priming them for a potential injury the following turn. (Wide) (Fragile)
#                 If a player Bunkers during the vulnerable turn, they will Damage themself.
#                 If a player gets electrified multiple times, they can gets damaged multiple times.
# Voltage II (10): If a players Trains during the vulnerable turn, they will Damage themself.
# Voltage III (10): If a players Goes to Class during the vulnerable turn, they will Die.
# Voltage IV (10): Gain a Charge.
#                  Each turn, consume a Charge to electrify all other players. (Blatant)
# Voltage V (10): Gain a Charge.
