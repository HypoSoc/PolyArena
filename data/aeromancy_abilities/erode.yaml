# Erode I (10): Whenever you attack a player, permanently reduce their Survivability by 1. (Narrow) (Fragile)
#               This affects even the Petrified forms of players.
# Erode II (10): +1 to your lowest Stat for every circuit attuned to Earth. (Fragile as if Geomancy)
#                You can attune an additional circuit to Earth
#                You gain a circuit.
# Erode III (5): Every turn, choose up to three players.
#                If, at the end of the turn, you have at least three circuits attuned to Earth,
#                permanently reduce their Survivability by 1 (including when Petrified). (Narrow) (Fragile)
