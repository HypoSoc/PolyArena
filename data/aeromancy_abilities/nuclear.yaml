# Nuclear I (10): As long as you have four circuits attuned to Light, you will kill everyone in range at the end of combat (including yourself). (Fragile as if Geomancy) (Unmistakable)
#                 You can attune an additional circuit to Light.
#                 You gain a circuit.
# Nuclear II (10): Gain 3 Lizard's Tails.
# Nuclear III (10): As long as you have two circuits attuned to Light, you can attack up to three players at once.
#                   You can attune an additional circuit to Light.
#                   You gain a circuit.
