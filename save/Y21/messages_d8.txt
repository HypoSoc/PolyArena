Drasky tells HypoSoc he has bad news and not so bad news: he's swapped control of his character and BlackLemonAde's character. But he has enough money for another Chronoshift Bomb, which isn't bad all things considered. 
Drasky asks Anemone to be warped. Anemone agrees. 
RyoAtemi (initiate) tells Swift he'll send him a Chronoshift bomb, and to use it if he dies. 
Witherbrine asks DragonLord what they're doing tonight. 
HypoSoc asks his co-conspirators if they're all set to buy a Chronoshift Bomb. Anemone says they might not be able to shop because they think some people will attack them tomorrow, citing Drasky being blackmailed for example.
TempelJaeger asks Paradosi if they still have their Arsonist abilities. Paradosi says it's unlikely to do anything since too many people are alive. TempelJaeger tries convincing Paradosi to use it.
Paradosi tells Witherbrine that maybe he CAN get the numbers below 8 after all, but Witherbrine tells him that HypoSoc is hoaring a lot of Chronoshift Bombs to take back everyone to D1, so it wouldn't work anyway.
TempelJaeger (initiate) creates a conversation with Anemone, RyoAtemi asking them if they think HypoSoc is playing them or not.
