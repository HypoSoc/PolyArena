Bedna shares with Mega that NinetyNineLies has a Patient temperament. Mega asks about the battle log for the night.
Bedna shares the night report with Mega.
DarkLight (initiate) asks Seventeen how Witherbrine even has runes, which should be impossible without a cheat like Seventeen's Aeromancy. Seventeen says it's not them and that they have Fire I and Earth II, so they might just have a source of progress. Tells DarkLight that Witherbrine is asking them to attack DarkLight with him, that he has antimagic hydro and a lot of progress. DarkLight wonders how it's even possible, calculates that Witherbrine needs to have somehow gained 20 progress by the end of Night 2 to make this work. Puzzling.
Darkpiplumon and Drasky wonder how their target could possibly have bunkered. They resolve to go for someone squishier next time.
DragonLord (initiate) begs to PocketRikimaru to not kill him (????), says it was HypoSoc's idea. PocketRikimaru isn't surprised it was HypoSoc's idea. Asks DragonLord to grovel. DragonLord grovels.
Drasky shares with DragonLord what PocketRikimaru was tring to shop for, as well as his Gold Attunement + MF1. DragonLord says he'll try to negotiate with PocketRikimaru.
HypoSoc writes in the fighter discussion that Bedna or Swift are likely the King, and that they'll be attacking Bedna. They suggest the fighterball plan their attack accordiningly. Drasky accepts to attack with them.
HypoSoc tells Drasky that they're gonna go to class and murder the classgoers. Asks Drasky if he was going to class or shopping D1 when he was forced to wander, Drasky says shop + that he suspects that most people who claim they were goint to class were saying it so that there were would be less classgoers.
HypoSoc pays Mega 1 credit to mud DarkLight again. Mega is surprised by how much HypoSoc hates the guy, but HypoSoc says it's just because he believes he is King. Mega shares that they've found someone with Patient and can do a bit of trolling. Shares that he got that information from Bedna who has profiling. Shares that NinetyNineLies is the Patient player. HypoSoc wonders if we might see a taunt being used.
HypoSoc offers Swift-Sama 1 credit for the n3 + n4 night reports.
NinetyNineLies tells HypoSoc he has the concept names of the two people who attacked him. HypoSoc offers 1 credit for his full report and the previous night report. NinetyNineLies wants 1 credit for just the full report. HypoSoc says that's only worth half a credit. NinetyNineLies says their concept have never apepared in the Aeropedia. HypoSoc refuses and wants the information for free.
Paradosi complains to HypoSoc about Seventeen's interruption. Wonders if he should target Mega next, asks if there's speedsters. HypoSoc says there isn't, but Witherbrine has a lot of survivability and Darkpiplumon + PocketRikimaru are swimming in credits. Paradosi will douse Witherbrine. Paradosi hesitates between shopping and healing, HypoSoc says he could heal today and mule for them the next day.
Paradosi (initiate) complains to Seventeen about them attacking him. Seventeen had a good reason though: Paradosi was injured. Paradosi offers to attack the King's enablers instead if Seventeen wants to attack people.
Paradosi reiterates to TempelJaeger that Mega's DEATH thing is bullshit.
Seventeen wonders about sabotage's existence in DarkLight's group, confirms that being attacked does indeed interrupt interruptible actions like crafting. DarkLight hypothesises he was a 1/1 if nothing else, since he has Body Reinforcement. Shares his surprises at not having been attacked during the night. Seventeen begs for charity, DarkLight says he coudln't tattoo himself (on account of all of the interruptions). Swift-Sama offers to have DarkLight teach him on N4, but DarkLight says he'll need to see the current turn's result first.
Seventeen replies to HypoSoc that Witherbrine have rune of their own. HypoSoc asks for information, offers a venom rune. Seventeen shares that he attacked Paradosi and that Teyao attacked him. Seventeen takes this as a confirmation that Sabotage is still in play.
TempelJaeger asks HypoSoc what happened during the night. HypoSoc claims he doesn't know as he doesn't have Awareness I. They have a deep philosophical discussion about what makes an ability worthwhile.
TempelJaeger repeats that Swift-Sama should know who the King is. Swift-Sama says he does, but refuses to share that information. TempelJaeger asks Swift-Sama how he sees the game ending, with all of his info.
Teyao tells Darkpiplumon that no one managed to injure anyone in the Paradosi fight.
Teyao (initiate) asks HypoSoc if they have venom. HypoSoc does have a supply. Teyao asks if he can have one for 1 credit, HypoSoc declines but suggests the same trade next turn.
Teyao asks RyoAtemi if they want to learn Geomancy. RyoAtemi agrees to being taught Circuit I.
Teyao asks in RyoAtemi's groupchat if anyone is interested in teaching or learning. RyoAtemi shares the Omniscience report. Teyao notes that he's been doused, notes that Void and Recursion are using their runes, and that it doesn't appear to be a good thing. Bedna shares that NinetyNineLies is Patient and that Mega will attack them N4.
Teyao asks TempelJaeger if he wants to be trained. TempelJaeger says he's too scared to do that.
Witherbrine asks Seventeen if he wants to murder DarkLight with him. Seventeen asks if he has anything to go around Combat Regen. Witherbrine replies that he has Antimagic (Hydro). Seventeen asks if he's sure he wants to reveal it that early, Witherbrine explains that his Aeromancy requires him to kill 2/3rd of the students to graduate. Seventeen says he can't help because he needs to shop.
