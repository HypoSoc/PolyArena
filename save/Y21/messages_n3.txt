DarkLight asks Swift-Sama for information and wishes them luck with his King identity perhaps close to being leaked, soft-probes for devs. Swift-Sama equivoques.
Darkpiplumon asks Drasky if they want to attack with them. Drasky wants to know Darkpiplumon's build. Darkpiplumon reveals he has decent combat and survival, but can't hurt people that bunker. They decide on NinetyNineLies, since they surely wouldn't bunker twice in a row.
Drasky asks Anemone for details about their Aeromancy and how it works when people go to class. Anemone has no details to share, as their Aeromancy doesn't affect people who go to class.
Drasky threatens Bedna. Bedna gives information on attunements for Darkpiplumon (they've gotten Earth), LordOfChromius (they're gotten Light, but died), and Witherbrine (they've gotten Fire but no additional circuits).
Drasky says "knock knock" to Coledon. Omnious.
Drasky asks DarkLight if he felt anything weird when Witherbrine attacked him. DarkLight says no. Drasky asks about Paradosi as a target, DarkLight says it was to do something.
Drasky tells HypoSoc he knew LordOfChromius had bad vibes. HypoSoc says he's not counting them as King, since King might just have been someone who wandered. Drasky asks for a Swift-Sama report, HypoSoc says he's shared everything he received. Gives Drasky the willpower reports for d1/n1 and the d1 training report.
Drasky (initiate) tells Paradosi that he hadn't noticed him attacking with him on N2. Asks if he can attack, but Paradosi hasn't been able to shop for a weapon, so no.
Drasky admits to PocketRikimaru that the credit thing was a ruse. PocketRikimaru had forgotten about it. He's chilling.
HypoSoc says in the fighterball chat that they'll be happy if Hotmonkey or LordOfChromius were King, but still will be on the lookout. Drasky notes that the attacks today were unexpected. DragonLord asks if anyone wants to join them for an attack tonight.
HypoSoc asks Seventeen if they got Witherbrine a Recursion Rune.
Mega (initiate) asks Bedna if they have profiling and could share Patient information. Says he need to Mud people by Night 4 so Night 3 is the last change for Profiling to find a Patient player.
Mega tells HypoSoc that he could claim to have gotten an H. HypoSoc replies that he's making a point not to lie about Aeromancies this game.
Mega asks TempelJaeger to claim they received a letter to see how Seventeen reacts. TempelJaeger is okay with it.
Paradosi (initiate) asks DarkLight about why he attacked him. DarkLight says it's because it was optimal: he was gonna be attacked, might as well hurt someone in the process.
Paradosi (initiate) asks DragonLord if he can get heals. No reply.
Paradosi asks HypoSoc if this means Swift-Sama is Omniscience, shares his concept with HypoSoc. HypoSoc instantly offers to target players that aren't doused and coordinate with Paradosi to hit the proper targets. Paradosi is targeting Mega as they're worried about DEATH. HypoSoc says they're bullshitting, asks for Paradosi to target Teyao or DarkLight first. They agree on going for Teyao.
Paradosi asks Witherbrine if he went for Aeromancy runes. Witherbrine did. Paradosi asks for a tattoo, but Witherbrine says he's not going for tattoos, but is focused on combat to kill DarkLight before they can resist anti-hydro abilities.
RyoAtemi talks with Paradosi.
RyoAtemi shares his report with his group, asks Swift-Sama if him not doing a King action was intentional or not. It's a weird question, given that RyoAtemi can literally see the actions Swift-Sama sent. Swift-Sama replies that his whole action got cancelled (which RyoAtemi should know by that point). They're annoyed at the GOD aeromancy.
Seventeen notes in the DarkLight group chat that Swift got caught by GOD. DarkLight thanks Seventeen for his gift, but wonders why he's attacking, and why he's attacking someone without hurting them to boot. Seventeen reveals he's an altuist and that he attacked to appear like a fighter. It's a shocking twist. He also admits to bad targeting. DarkLight offers targeting advice.
Seventeen (initiate) opens communications with Witherbrine. Witherbrine asks for runes/tattoos, but Seventeen can't provide that.
Swift-Sama gives Drasky PocketRikimaru's attempted action. Drasky asks questions about PocketRikimaru's build, Darkpiplumon's actions, and 99's items. Swift-Sama says he needs something in return, Drasky says it's fair and asks what he wants in return.
TempelJaeger (initiate) asks Paradosi if they're an intel build. Paradosi isn't one, but shares that Mega lies.
Teyao asks Darkpiplumon if they wanna attack. Darkpiplumon is tentatively curious. Teyao asks if they have a gas mask, Darkpiplumon does have one. The plan is they attack Seventeen. Darkpiplumon asks why they're doing this, Teyao says it's to do a mild bit of trolling. Darkpiplumon declines.
