DarkLight tells DragonLord that God stopped their trade. They agree to try again.
DarkLight congratulates Seventeen on their kill. Seventeen says he got a grievous wound out of it. DarkLight can't heal them (because duh). Seventeen asks for any spies. DarkLight doesn't know any.
HypoSoc asks how Drasky's night was, ask if he is Haruspex. He isn't. HypoSoc shares that Scapegoat is real. Shares he'll have antimagic (geo) this action. Asks HypoSoc if they're Split or Chameleon and what they do. Drasky says neither, but hypothesises that Darkpiplumon is Chameleon, because of the John Cena meme. HypoSoc says he's got that information from NNL. Shares WEALTH/SAVIOR info. Drasky relents and admits he's split, says it's something where he can split pieces of himself to avoid injuries like lizard tails, but that it's useless for him. Shares that Mega told him that Darkpiplumon told Mega that TempelJaeger is ðŸŽ° AUGUR X SCAPEGOAT ðŸŽ°. HypoSoc is skeptical, as why would TempelJaeger attack Bedna? Drasky wonders if it's new combinations every turn, but HypoSoc believes Augur X Scapegoat is too specific, and they knew Scapegoat was in play long ago thanks to Omniscience.
HypoSoc tells Mega that nobody else was attacking Swift-Sama. Asks if anyone attacked Pocket. Mega says he'll go ask. HypoSoc shares that Swift was trying to train. Mega notes that if their teacher was attacked, they would default to train. Mega says he saw a night report and that it doesn't make sense (so Swift is not Omniscience). HypoSoc says they're tattooed with Combat Regen. HypoSoc asks for the night report, Mega gives the night report. HypoSoc notes that TempelJaeger might have been hit by their own Scapegoat. Clarify that PocketRikimaru had indeed bought a weapon alongside their Liquid Memories. They wonder if PocketRikimaru has a defensive Aeromancy. They also wonder how any of this is possible if PocketRikimaru has a "big weapon" as they attacked HypoSoc and failed to attack them, but HypoSoc damaged them. They wonder if there's misinformation going on. Mega shares the ðŸŽ° AUGUR X SCAPEGOAT ðŸŽ° from Darkpiplumon. HypoSoc thinks it's BS, because why not post it publicly, because TempelJaeger didn't say they had this, and because TempelJaeger got hit by the blast. They think there's 5 possible things happening: Darkpiplumon is lying, Swift-Sama/Darklight lied and Scapegoat isn't TempelJaeger, there is another Portent Aeromancy, TempelJaeger played badly, or Zeal gave a player X. Mega points out that the lottery emoji were part of the report. They say TempelJaeger is a problem. HypoSoc shares the result they got from NinetyNineLies with Split, Chameleon etc. Mega isn't happy about aeromancies. HypoSoc mentions that Drasky told them they had split, Lizard Tails at a cost.
HypoSoc asks TempelJaeger how their night was, sharing that they attacked Swift-Sama. TempelJaeger says confusing: they knew Bedna was weak, but not that weak. Asks HypoSoc if they'll go for Swift-Sama again today, or zug-zug to classes. HypoSoc says he'll interrupt a CR build again. TempelJaeger asks for info, as his options are pretty constrained this turn.
Mega asks for the combat result in the 5p clusterfuck conversation. DragonLord posts them. PocketRikimaru says he can't attack as Drasky is attacking him. Mega notices that Swift-Sama tried training, which indicates he's not Omniscience. Darkpiplumon shares that the auspicious sign message comes from ðŸŽ° AUGUR X SCAPEGOAT ðŸŽ°. Everyone is confused and wonders if Zeal is insane enough to make aeromancies that randomly cycle through other aeromancies.
Mega asks RyoAtemi for a night report. RyoAtemi gives him the combat report.
Mega tells Teyao that to win, they'll probably need 2 cheat sheets, or maybe 3 even.
Mega tells Teyao they know they are Wealth. Teyao says he's also Gold so lots of credits. Teyao says he'll buy Chronoshift bombs, Mega reminds him he needs some Memories, but Teyao plans on just dying and being spiteful.
NinetyNineLies tells DragonLord he doesn't hold a grudge, asks how he feels about Chronoshift bombs. DragonLord feels negatively as he's at 0A. NinetyNineLies wonders what his strategy to win is, as he's consistently attacked people but only 3/21 are dead. Wonders if he's in an alliance with HypoSoc and DragonLord. DragonLord says he's just doing what he can. NinetyNineLies offers DragonLord a plan: they both buy Chronoshift Bombs, and then they go to class D6. DragonLord agrees, asks what NinetyNineLies can do.
NinetyNineLies offers HypoSoc 4 names of concepts for 1 credit. HypoSoc agrees. NinetyNineLies shares that Darkpiplumon/Drasky are SPLIT/CHAMELEON, and that Teyao/Drasky are WEALTH/SAVIOR.
NinetyNineLies (initiate) asks Teyao why they attacked him out of everyone. Teyao doesn't really have any reason for doing so.
PocketRikimaru tells Drasky that he's free to try again, and that his bunker is pretty solid. Says he's good with 3 academics and bunkering the rest of the game. Is sad about his lost bokken, but such is life.
PocketRikimaru tells Paradosi that he didn't erase D5.
RyoAtemi posts his report in his chat, but no one replies. poor RyoAtemi.
Seventeen tells HypoSoc that he's grievously wounded. HypoSoc deduces TempelJaeger is Scapegoat, asks for who else is wounded. Tells Seventeen he's sending him a Toxin rune.
TempelJaeger asks Mega how they win. Mega says academics. They discuss aeromancies, Haruspex, and the likes. Mega shares the Awareness report. TempelJaeger shares his willpower report to find the MF2 players maybe.
TempelJaeger asks RyoAtemi what their plan to win is. RyoAtemi says random acts of chaos.
TempelJaeger tells Seventeen that it was an annoying night, but that at least they got a kill.
TempelJaeger tells Swift-Sama that they should diplo to get stuff moving.
