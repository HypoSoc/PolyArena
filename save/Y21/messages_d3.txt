DarkLight complains to Mega about the attack. Mega says it's only business.
DarkLight is fed up with Seventeen's bullshit, as he still hasn't received a rune. Seventeen claims to have sent a rune to Swift-Sama, which Swift-Sama confirms. DarkLight notes that he had two runes, and that DarkLight + Swift-Sama was 2 people. DarkLight is mollified and agrees that maybe Seventeen isn't betraying them and just got interrupted tonight, which Seventeen doesn't confirm or deny. DarkLight is still unhappy, but posts the Awareness report, asks for some reports if anyone has them. Seventeen shares information he got from Hotmonkey. Mocks HypoSoc for thinking Swift-Sama is Omniscience and DarkLight King. DarkLight, very ironically, says that "One day soon, someone with Unnatural Intuition will be able to run around punching people in order to test these things. On that day a lot of people are going to start feeling pretty dumb.". It was HypoSoc's build last game.
DragonLord asks DarkLight for Awareness II reports. DarkLight doesn't have any. Warns about the HypoSoc group potentially murderizing everyone.
Drasky tells Bedna that the healing beam seems to be a healing ability. Wonders what they were teaching Hotmonkey, as Attunement detection is redundant. No reply.
Drasky (initiate) asks Coledon if they're planning on attacking. No reply.
Drasky threatends Darkpiplumon (as they're doing absolutely jack shit at the moment). Darkpiplumon says they will attack every night after that turn. Drasky helpfully offers to help with the target selection. Darkpiplumon agrees. They float TempelJaeger and LordOfChromius as potential targets.
Drasky asks DragonLord for a d2 training report. They don't have it, as their source was Hotmonkey (who is dead). DragonLord complains about his night not being successful.
Drasky congratulates HypoSoc for a well-done attack, and asks for a spy report. HypoSoc doesn't have a spy report (as they just killed the person who provided that report to them (Hotmonkey (who is dead))). Drasky says that DragonLord has been healing people (as he's been leaked as Savior), which is a mood. Shares that TempelJaeger and LordOfChromius are heading for Earth II and should be taken out. They agree to strike LordOfChromius together.
Drasky sends a cryptic message to NinetyNineLies (I seriously don't understand what he means by it). Claims that NinetyNineLies was briefed on the method behind shopping, asks if he's told other. No reply.
Drasky asks Seventeen why PocketRikimaru is a priority target. Seventeen replies that PocketRikimaru not doing anything crazy means that he'll do crazy stuff later. It is sound logic. Seventeen is unsure if they can harm PocketRikimaru though, Drasky asks them what they need to hurt PocketRikimaru, mentioning "more tattoos" as a possibility.
Drasky threatens Swift-Sama. They want info. Swift-Sama offers info, asks what Drasky wants. Drasky wants training info, shopping purchases, teaching actions, and to know who the biggest threats are. Swift-Sama says Mega, and that he lied about DEATH. Also mentions that Witherbrine is producing Runes of Void, which sounds suitably omnious. And that Paradosi is an Arsonist. Says they can only douse while bunkering and has doused Coledon. Mentions HypoSoc is venom. Drasky asks about LordOfChromius and TempelJaeger. Swift-Sama says they're both headed for Earth II, and that LordOfChromius keeps training at night. Drasky asks about PocketRikimaru's deal.
HypoSoc tells the fighterball group (Drasky, Coledon, DragonLord) that Swift-Sama has Combat Regen. Drasky mentions that he may start cracking statues soon. HypoSoc says maybe they can just run them out of willpower. HypoSoc asks if they wanna double up someone. Drasky asks for targets. HypoSoc mentions PocketRikimaru. DragonLord offers to hit PocketRikimaru. They collectively ponder Seventeen and Paradosi's builds, although DragonLord mentions Paradosi was seen training Body Reinforcement I earlier. HypoSoc claims that they've pushed Seventeen to attack. Drasky shares that he's made Darkpiplumon start attacking during the night. HypoSoc asks about a double up, post the Omniscience list of Aeromancies, courtesy of Swift-Sama.
LordOfChromius shares the night report with DragonLord. DragonLord asks about the training report.
Mega reports to HypoSoc that the hit job was successful but that DarkLight was Combat Regen. Mega tries to push for killing Swift-Sama. HypoSoc refuses, saying they're likely Omniscience. Pushes Mega toward petrification, as Drasky is close to statue-breaking. Mega refuses, citing that if he does that he'll just get killed when his usefulness runs out.
Mega (initiate) asks Swift-Sama how Omniscience is working out for them. Vaguely threatens them because they "really want DarkLight's regen". Swift-Sama throws shade at Mega's DEATH letters (which are bullshit). Mega tells them that they should throw someone under the bus to buy themselves time.
Paradosi asks HypoSoc is they also expected Drasky to hit Hotmonkey. HypoSoc explains that it was done so for redundancy, since Warp was in play. HypoSoc later tells Paradosi that he's received a list of Aeromancers, and will post it as it's already "spreading around" (it contains Paradosi's name).
Paradosi and RyoAtemi discuss the specifics of the God aeromancy. They don't understand it. They agree that Mega is probably lying about DEATH.
RyoAtemi shares his report with his group. Teyao is annoyed by having been attacked, but unhurt. RyoAtemi compiles a list of Aeromancies. Asks if he should send it to HypoSoc. Swift-Sama offers to do it for them, as they're pretending to be Omniscience. They agree to send a truncated list with their names redacted off of it.
Seventeen wonders to HypoSoc if TempelJaeger is Omniscience, as they've been taught a lot. Decides to attack them. HypoSoc is pretty sure Swift-Sama is Omniscience, with King aligned with Omniscience. HypoSoc later tells Seventeen that he's received a list of Aeromancers, and will post it as it's already "spreading around" (it contains Seventeen's name).
Swift-Sama shares the Aeromancy list to HypoSoc. HypoSoc asks if it can be public. Swift-Sama is okay with it as long as his name isn't on it.
Swift-Sama (initiate) tells DarkLight that they have received a Recursion Rune, as HypoSoc did. DarkLight asks where they got the information from. Swift-Sama says it's Omniscience, but that they can't tell who it is. DarkLight asks if Mega is lying about getting paid or not, thinking it's either lies or Drasky ordered the hit. Swift-Sama says it's obviously bull and he doesn't even need to check it, and that Mega is just doing this because he thinks Swift-Sama is Omniscience.
TempelJaeger shamelessly asks HypoSoc for info, as Hotmonkey died. HypoSoc doesn't have info. HypoSoc apologizes to TempelJaeger for sharing his aeromancy in global chat. TempelJaeger mentions that Legacy Magic Scapegoat makes zero sense, goes on addressing the rumors about his Aeromancy in the public thread.
TempelJaeger suggests Mega that he could go to the Doctor to clear DEATH. Asks Mega what he'll do N3. Mega says he doesn't know, as they might be dead by then. They both have forgotten that Mega has already told TempelJaeger that DEATH was bullshit. Mega asks if TempelJaeger needs teaching, but TempelJaeger expects to be attacked, so takes a raincheck on it.
Teyao unhelpfully tells Darkpiplumon that "Witherbrine is doing weird shit with runes". Gives Darkpiplumon the list of aeros that they agreed Swift-Sama would spread. Darkpiplumon asks if they have aeromancy intuition and know who King/Omniscience is. Teyao tells him they think Swift-Sama is Omniscience.
Teyao apologizes to TempelJaeger, he couldn't train as he was attacked by DragonLord and Coledon. They agree to teach/learn later.
