Bedna tells Mega that the effort was in vain.
DarkLight asks Seventeen why the fuck they gave HypoSoc and Witherbrine Recursion runes, given that they immediately started trying to kill him afterwards. Also asks why, if he's done that, he gave DarkLight Recursion and runes and taught him. Confesses that he's confused and has no idea what Seventeen's plans are. Seventeen says he hasn't given Witherbrine any runes. HypoSoc was just him diversifying his alliance prospects, and that he got a Toxin rune out of it. Seventeen says he's not picking a side in the HypoSoc/DarkLight's rivalry. DarkLight says HypoSoc doesn't want to kill them, he wants OTHER people to kill them while he wins through academics. Says he wants HypoSoc dead but similarly wont expend any effort making it happen. Seventeen says he can attack the people who atatcked DarkLight recently. DarkLight says that's Mega and that Witherbrine is dangerous if antimagic is indeed something they have. Asks Seventeen if they can even win against them. Seventeen says that nah he'd win. Says he'll use Toxin to get Venom next turn. DarkLight asks about the text of Toxin, forgetting that it is an ability that exists already.
Darkpiplumon makes a group chat with 5 random players (Mega, DragonLord, PocketRikimaru, Teyao) to stop NinetyNineLies and DarkLight from shopping (???). There's a lot of confused discussion and some of them agree to hit 99 together.
DragonLord asks DarkLight if they can join their cabal. DarkLight says he doesn't have one but is coordinating with people that are mostly backstabbers. Asks for DragonLord's stats/credit situation/abilities nonetheless. DragonLord says he's a 2/2 with 7 credits, and has Savior, which removes negative conditions to people like injuries, slime, mud etc... and has 3 charges. DarkLight says it looks shiny but is kinda useless, says they'll dump all of their credits on DragonLord because while 7 credits is a lot, 15 credits is game-changing amounts of money, and DragonLord can buy things with it that might make DarkLight win (Liquid Memories, Chronoshift Bombs, etc). He tells DragonLord that Omniscience would see them buying three Liquid Memories but that some buys might have a chance to turn the game in their favor. DragonLord agrees.
Drasky asks Anemone if the timeskip was from their Aeromancy. Anemone thinks it's from Void. Express stupefaction at how they got King-Crimsoned. Drasky disagrees that King Crimson works this way.
Drasky keeps threatening PocketRikimaru. PocketRikimaru still doesn't agree to giving up a Liquid Memory.
Drasky asks Witherbrine if they did this. Witherbrine says no, reiterates that they have lost. Drasky asks if "your efforts are in vain" is Witherbrine's Aeromancy. It's not, but Witherbrine offers to track down the guy who did that since he'll grab Aeromancy intuition soon. Witherbrine says he can shut down fragile Hydromancers now, and soon Geomancers.
HypoSoc wonders if him and Drasky can win through chronoshift bombs thanks to their early academics. Drasky says it's possible but risky. HypoSoc agrees, but thinks they might need to employ risky strategies at some point anyway. Thinks they ought to stockpile credits in case it becomes needed.
HypoSoc sets up the conditional trade with Teyao again.
Mega asks HypoSoc if they need DarkLight's progress stalled. HypoSoc says not during the night. Mega tells HypoSoc that PocketRikimaru has a lot of Liquid Memories. HypoSoc says that it's not gonna be true if it comes from Omniscience as he assumes PocketRikimaru has Ablative Ossification, and Omniscience would just not mention that. Mega says the information comes from Teyao. Mentions that Darkpiplumon made a group to stall classgoers but thinks it's just a distraction for Darkpiplumon and PocketRikimaru to win through Liquid Memories and Chronoshift bombs. Mega justifies telling HypoSoc this because too many people are alive. HypoSoc considers that if anyone didn't buy AO, it would be PocketRikimaru. Says they'll help killing them if they get a soft/they get proven to be disarmed. They commiserate about how the D5 skip slowed down the game even more.
Mega asks Teyao is they want to ally to win the game together. Teyao says sure, shares that he has Gold and Combat Regen, asks what Mega can do. Mega says he has Mud and a fair amount of credits, and that HypoSoc has been paying them for all attacks on DarkLight. Says that money can get them to win through timebombs and liquid memories, but that Omniscience would see them and that they'd need to be careful with the timings. Mentions that PocketRikimaru has Gold. Teyao says Darkpiplumon has Gold too. Mega isn't happy with that. Teyao mentions that PocketRikimaru has bought at least 3 Liquid Memories as well, Mega says he'll tell that to HypoSoc to see if they could kill PocketRikimaru.
NinetyNineLies asks HypoSoc again about him buying the mystery Aeromancy names for 1 credit. Asks to confirm that they message for D5 is the same, HypoSoc confirms but refuses the trade still.
Paradosi tells HypoSoc that they will have BR2 and a Sword after D6, so proccing Congealing Will won't be an issue. Then says "scratch all that".
Paradosi asks PocketRikimaru if they're the one who erased D5.
Paradosi tells RyoAtemi about how they lost their Patient devs. RyoAtemi commiserates.
Paradosi complains to Witherbrine that they couldn't even get Patient devs nor shop which sucks.
RyoAtemi laughs in his chat about how Anemone figured everything up and HypoSoc is wrong (but HypoSoc is right in this instance, as Slip is not working with King/Omniscience)
Seventeen (initiate) asks Coledon what they've been up to.
Seventeen says he'd offer to teach one of DarkLight's not-cabal, but it sounds like a bad idea. Asks if anyone wants to interrupt people. DarkLight says he doesn't want to because he doesn't have any reliable stats on people's durability. Seventeen says that's still fine if they interrupt a teaching action, suggests Teyao or TempelJaeger.
Seventeen tells Drasky that they're attacking Bedna tonight.
Seventeen tells HypoSoc that they're going to start trying to kill the altruists that don't have CR yet. Asks for more toxin runes. HypoSoc says he doesn't have runes right now as he got attacked by PocketRikimaru for some reason. Says Teyao and Ryo have combat regen. Seventeen says he'll go for Congealing Will, HypoSoc says he'll go for Antimagic.
TempelJaeger says he can spend four actions interrupting Swift (???) and that he's gonna change his methods, if HypoSoc can kill RyoAtemi. HypoSoc asks for information on RyoAtemi. HypoSoc says RyoAtemi has Combat Regen that they learned from Teyao. TempelJaeger asks who's easy to kill. HypoSoc says PocketRikimaru, Aab (???), Darkpiplumon, Bedna. TempelJaeger says he'll stay on target and hope for the best.
Teyao says in the economics club that the year is looking grim, PocketRikimaru agrees.
