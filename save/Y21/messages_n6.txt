Darkpiplumon offers DarkLight to not attack them for the rest of the game for 1 credit. DarkLight says it's worthless because someone else would attack anyway.
Darkpiplumon tells Mega in the clusterfuck conversation that they saw ðŸŽ° AUGUR X SCAPEGOAT ðŸŽ°. A lot of ooing and aahing happens.
DragonLord says he can still mule for DarkLight. DarkLight will try to send credits today too, but is annoyed by God.
Drasky asks Anemone if they can deal with TempelJaeger. Anemone has Warp. Drasky asks for the full text of the Aeromancy again. Anemone gives it to Drasky. AGAIN. Anemone also mentions they have crafting I.
Drasky asks DarkLight why they attacked Darkpiplumon. Spite. Drasky offers a mule in exchange for DarkLight attacking RyoAtemi. DarkLight refuses as they have other plans.
Drasky asks Darkpiplumon why DarkLight attacked them. Darkpiplumon doesn't know.
Drasky asks DragonLord what they did last turn. DragonLord missed the action deadline.
Drasky says they're slamming into Earth II if Teyao wants to heal them. Teyao has plans.
Drasky asks Paradosi what they tried last action. Shop. Asks what they were trying to buy. Sword, Weave, Booby Trap. Drasky offers to mule for Paradosi.
Drasky asks Seventeen if they have a Sword. They do. They ask for the sword, mentions breaking statues. No reply.
HypoSoc asks Drasky to murder Mega with them. They're cool with it. HypoSoc asks if they can get armor break for PocketRikimaru. They'll try to ascertain his survivability at a later date. They wonder if anyone is close to Reality Imposition or Petrification for TempelJaeger. HypoSoc asks how many credit total they had during their successful shop and their unsuccessful shop. Drasky says the same amount (???) HypoSoc doesn't understand the Aeromancy.
HypoSoc reiterates that God is Aab. Doesn't know how it works. TempelJaeger is confused. Who the fuck is Aab?
HypoSoc asks Paradosi to tell them they have Petrification. They don't: no patient dev + forced to wander. HypoSoc asks if they shopped + what they bought to try and figure out the Divine Aeromancy. Paradosi says Sword and Weave, plus a Booby Trap.
Mega and HypoSoc discuss the game. Gold is a concern, cause a lot of Chronoshift Bombs might get bought. Oh, and also Augur X Scapegoat with 20 devs a turn's a problem.
Mega congratulates TempelJaeger on their mad science. TempelJaeger is disappointed that their Aeromancy doesn't let them farm their own corpse for free 20 devs a turn. Overall -- not too bad, he could snowball.
Mega asks what Teyao bought. Chronoshift Bomb. Yeah, just 1 Chronoshift Bomb.
NinetyNineLies (initiate) asks Seventeen if they'd try and get Drasky or HypoSoc killed. Offers 2 credits to attack either of them.
Paradosi warns that they're gonna douse Witherbrine. Doesn't really matter though since too many alive. Witherbrine appreciates the warning.
RyoAtemi shares his report in his chat. Teyao shares that ðŸŽ° AUGUR X SCAPEGOAT ðŸŽ° is an Aeromancy. RyoAtemi asks Swift-Sama to pass some info, but he's already outed as King by HypoSoc. Swift-Sama asks for a Poison Gas to fuck over HypoSoc. It'd be hilarious.
Seventeen asks DarkLight if they want a sword. DarkLight isn't too keen on it because he'd just lose it. Seventeen offers to teach him MA2, which... is missing the point somewhat. Seventeen offers to send BR2/BR3 runes sometime, which also misses the point.
Seventeen (initiate) congratulates Darkpiplumon on grabbing Aeromancy Intuition. Darkpiplumon says that so far it's been not very useful.
Seventeen asks if HypoSoc needs a sword. HypoSoc says yes, and it'd help killing PocketRikimaru in the future.
TempelJaeger says RyoAtemi could learn Resurrection from them. RyoAtemi says they'd need to survive the bounty that TempelJaeger put on them. TempelJaeger says it's nothing personal, and that they just need RyoAtemi to die. Lol.
TempelJaeger tries getting information from Swift-Sama, but nothing gets exchanged.
Teyao asks PocketRikimaru in the Economics club if they really bought 3LM. Find out later, says PocketRikimaru.
Teyao asks RyoAtemi if they want to learn Geomancy. RyoAtemi says why not, asks for Water I.
