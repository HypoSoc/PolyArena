DarkLight asks DragonLord if they were actually warped or God'd. DragonLord confirms it was a Warp. DarkLight enquires about DragonLord's group chat. No reply.
DarkLight asks Drasky if he's still in the business of wildly throwing shade. Mentions he had subscribed to that newsletter. Banter ensues.
DarkLight tells Hotmonkey that sharing the willpower report publicly is uncalled for. Hotmonkey distracts him with tales of Y8 Paradosi using soul strike on automatas to kill off people at a rapid rate. DarkLight CRUELLY MOCKS Zeal for dying to the gas tax immediately.
DarkLight (initiate) asks Mega if the attack was business or pleasure. Mega admits that someone paid them to hit DarkLight. Mega fishes for info on Swift being the King, but DarkLight remarks that if they were allied with Omniscience, they wouldn't need to ask if someone put a hit on their head. Mega declines to name their client.
Darkpiplumon (initiate) asks HypoSoc about targets. HypoSoc names Anemone, Bedna, Hotmonkey, PocketRikimaru, and Swift-Sama. Darkpiplumon agrees, but feels Anemone might bunker.
Darkpiplumon (initiate) asks Mega if he has good targets that won't bunker. Mega suggests Swift, who he reasons must be Omniscience.
Darkpiplumon asks Teyao if they have ideas of stuff to do as they're bored. Teyao suggests hitting Seventeen, who's doing weird tattoo shit. Darkpiplumon thinks it's a good idea, but some other day perhaps.

Drasky asks Bedna for the attunement report. Bedna says it's the same as the previous day.
Drasky asks Darkpiplumon why they wanted to attack 99. Darkpiplumon says it's because they tried to shop.
Drasky tries bullying Hotmonkey into giving him the willpower report. Hotmonkey doesn't give them the willpower report, but reiterates that DarkLight spent 2 willpower last turn and is likely Combat Regeneration.
Drasky asks HypoSoc how certain they are that Hotmonkey is sabotage. Answer: pretty sure, as Hotmonkey claimed to Seventeen to be able to teach Sabotage, plus have aero/wp detection. Drasky shares that Bedna lied about teaching Hotmonkey Aero Intuition (this might be a mistake on their part? Bedna claimed to teach Attunement Detection).
Drasky tells PocketRikimaru that if he gives him a credit, he'll double it (as his Aero allows him to dupe credits). PocketRikimaru appears enthused by the news.
Hotmonkey asks Bedna to teach them tonight. Bedna agrees. Hotmonkey asks Bedna if they know of other spies that might form a cabal with them.
Hotmonkey (initiate) offers Mega help with his letter problem, but only if they attack then bunker. Mega is intrigued by the proposal, and asks for more details. Hotmonkey says he has found a way to redirect the letters.
Hotmonkey asks Witherbrine about their extra progress. Witherbrine admits to having a progress Aeromancy with drawbacks. Hotmonkey asks about the drawbacks. No reply.
HypoSoc asks the fighterball group chat if anyone was warped. DragonLord mentions he was warped. Drasky posts a geomancy report in chat. HypoSoc wonders if they got it from Swift-Sama. Drasky didn't but says his source might have gotten it from him. HypoSoc asks if anyone has 5+ combat. DragonLord shares that he has been healed by the beam of light. HypoSoc gets the group to hit Hotmonkey to remove Sabotage from play. Coledon doesn't talk in chat and is called out for it.
HypoSoc thanks Mega for their attack. They wonder if DarkLight is really the King, given the regen. Mega tells HypoSoc that Hotmonkey came to them offering a solution for their fake letter problem. Mega tells HypoSoc he was asked to attack then bunker. HypoSoc is perplexed by this. HypoSoc offers Mega a credit D3 for an attack on DarkLight on N2.
HypoSoc asks Seventeen about why there's no runes either this turn, Seventeen says he was forced to wander but is okay with it since it didn't feed the King. HypoSoc notes that the wanderers are probably massively shoppers.
HypoSoc asks TempelJaeger why they bunkered. TempelJaeger replies that it's because it's free stats. HypoSoc is confused.
Paradosi has ceased any independent thoughts and asks HypoSoc who has 0/0. HypoSoc mentions Pocket, Anemone, and DarkLight, though he has likely Combat Regen. Paradosi doesn't like the target. HypoSoc mentions Hotmonkey. Paradosi asks who among these is HypoSoc's pick for an attack. HypoSoc says Hotmonkey.
Paradosi (initiate) opens discussion with RyoAtemi. RyoAtemi shares that he was stopped from shopping but that there was no prior warning.
RyoAtemi asks TempelJaeger whether or not they got the God invalid action prompt. TempelJaeger and RyoAtemi ponder on the intricacies of this aeromancy.
