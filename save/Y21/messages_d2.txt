Anemone reminds Drasky to keep 1 credit unused when shopping. Drasky asks for the name of Anemone's aeromancy, for his peace of mind. Anemone counters by offering to teach Drasky circuits II at night instead. Drasky and Anemone are both confused. Anemone tells Drasky that their Aeromancy is called Styx and that it's effect is that everyone must always have 1 credit on them.
DarkLight asks Swift-Sama in his group chat whether or not he got a lot of progress. They ask why Seventeen didn't send a rune either. Seventeen says he was asleep, and also that he forgot that you could send items on the turn you acquired them. Seventeen mentions Hotmonkey is probably Omniscience. DarkLight muses on whether or not they should include Omniscience into their cabal. Swift-Sama becomes the first person to mention that it's likely none of the Aeromancies have a level 2. Seventeen relays that Hotmonkey wants their rune for Sabotage and that they might just be an Omniscience ally. Swift-Sama confirms that Hotmonkey has Sabotage. DarkLight is saddened by Coledon having checked out of the cabal.
Darkpiplumon (initiate) asks Witherbrine what happened. Witherbrine gloats.
DragonLord asks Coledon if he would like to hit Anemone today. No reply.
Drasky (initiate) asks Bedna what they were trying to teach. Bedna claims it was Attunement detection. Drasky says it is weird. Bedna provides the attunement list.
Drasky sends memes to PocketRikimaru. They're good.
Drasky asks Witherbrine for information on their build. No reply.
Hotmonkey asks Anemone who might be sending letters to Mega. They don't know.
Hotmonkey tells Bedna that spies aren't doing too well. Asks Bedna to turn off Sabotage so that DarkLight gets hurt this turn. Bedna asks Hotmonkey to pretend they were teaching them attunement detection. Mentions that Drasky is likely Aeromancy Intuition.
Hotmonkey (initiate) tells BlackLemonAde that DarkLight is likely to be the King and asks for help attacking. BlackLemonAde apologizes and explains he can't attack without shopping.
Hotmonkey tells DragonLord that DarkLight is probably King. Hotmonkey thanks DragonLord for the healing beam if it was from their cabal. Asks about Witherbrine's survivability. DragonLord doesn't confirm anything about the beam of light, ask for why DarkLight is King. Hotmonkey explains that King and Omniscience are likely allied. Lists target that didn't train D1 that could be Omniscience, concludes that DarkLight/Swift-Sama is the most likely King/Omniscience combo. DragonLord tells Hotmonkey that HypoSoc claimed they have Omniscience info. Hotmonkey denies this.
Hotmonkey complains to Drasky about their choice of target. Drasky points very reasonably that he couldn't know that Bedna was teaching Hotmonkey in particular. Hotmonkey makes suppositions on who Omniscience is, says that Anemone is likely GOD, thinks that Omniscience is in Swift/DarkLight.
Hotmonkey (initiate) asks Seventeen about getting runes. Seventeen agrees to exchanging a Rune of Runic Tattoos and a Rune of Rune Crafting II for a lifetime supply of information, but needs a couple of turns to stockpile them. Hotmonkey asks if he can have them by d3, and shares his D1 and N1 reports.
Hotmonkey asks Swift-Sama if he's Omniscience. Asks about King. Hotmonkey is very worried about King. Swift-Sama tells him he's not Omniscience. If he was, he'd sell out King in a heartbeat. Mentions that he's been learning from DarkLight because they're allied and he's an Altruist. Hotmonkey is disconscerted by the news.
Hotmonkey thanks Teyao for the heal. Teyao doesn't deny healing them. Hotmonkey shares their report with Teyao and asks if they're healing today. Teyao thinks he might teach instead.
HypoSoc (initiate) creates the inevitable fighterball group with DragonLord, Drasky, and Coledon, as they're the only ones who attacked so far. They offer a NAP and coordination to kill the Warper. Asks the injured fighters to not waste an action going to the doctor. Drasky mentions that Teyao is likely an altruistic healer. HypoSoc gives information on Anemone: they're the warper and were ratted by the Omniscience player. DragonLord is willing to attack them. Drasky questions this -- isn't Anemone the Divinity Aeromancer? HypoSoc says that anyone who taught + Anemone are good targets. HypoSoc shares that Hotmonkey has Sabotage. Ultimate, in a mad scramble for time, nothing gets really coordinated.
HypoSoc shares the night report with Drasky. Drasky highlights Hotmonkey being taught, and mentions they have a source alleging that DarkLight is the King. HypoSoc replies that he trusts that information.
HypoSoc asks Hotmonkey for the night report. Hotmonkey mentions that "Witherbrine almost certaintly Earth II, Coledon THREE. Omniscience likely to be Swift.". HypoSoc mentions having been warped, and says King is a problem. Hotmonkey supposes King might be DarkLight since King and Omniscience are likely allied.
HypoSoc (initiate) apologizes to Mega for being aggro in the public chat, and explains that he wanted to attract attention away. Says DarkLight is probably King and Swift-Sama probably Omniscience, and allied. Offers Mega 1 credit for them to attack DarkLight. Megaolix agrees. Megaolix thinks TempelJaeger is also a solid option for Omniscience. Megaolix admits to bullshitting, and says that Seventeen calling them out proves they're talking with Omniscience (or are Omniscience). Megaolix asks for the night log, HypoSoc shares it.
HypoSoc asks Seventeen why he didn't send the rune. Seventeen had gone to sleep before sending it. Seventeen mentions Hotmonkey is probably Omniscience. HypoSoc says Hotmonkey is in communications with Omniscience at least. Reveals he is Toxin. Seventeen tells HypoSoc that Hotmonkey claim to have Sabotage. HypoSoc informs Seventeen that if they give Hotmonkey runes, they'll have to attack Hotmonkey.
HypoSoc asks Swift-Sama who warped them and if they could name all of the people who trained. Promises to not attack Swift-Sama until there's 3 players left over if he gives him info. Swift-Sama gives him the names of everyone who trained and Anemone's name as the warper, refuses to namedrop the King but explains that PocketRikimaru and Darkpiplumon have GOLD, and that Paradosi has Arsonist that is targeted on people. HypoSoc asks if DEATH is bullshit from Megaolix, Swift-Sama says it's very likely.
HypoSoc asks TempelJaeger if they attacked to prevent training. TempelJaeger hasn't attacked (which HypoSoc obviously knows). HypoSoc shares the combat logs, mentions that things aren't going well. Asks TempelJaeger to attack. Not a whole lot gets accomplished.
LordOfChromius gives DragonLord the awareness I report. Claims Witherbrine has an Aeromancy that hurts people in range. DragonLord points out it's just Earth 2. LordOfChromius hopes that it's true, it would mean Witherbrine doesn't have an Aeromancy.
Paradosi tells HypoSoc he'd go Unnatural Intuition but is scared to be permanently Warped. HypoSoc thinks it's a non-issue and that there's only 1 warper. HypoSoc pushes Paradosi to attack before it's too late to kill the King. Paradosi agrees. HypoSoc mentions that people, on average, probably have about 0 combat if they've never attacked. Reiterates that King is dangerous and that people who train at night are feeding the King.
RyoAtemi tells Teyao he's made a group of Aeromancers and that they need to stick together to survive (what). They ask him if he wants to join, Teyao agrees.
RyoAtemi continues sharing information with their cabal, adds Teyao to the group. Shares that they have Sabotage. Asks if anyone might teach them. Teyao mentions they're a healer looking for work. Swift-Sama shares that a lot of people think they are Omniscience, but he doesn't mind it much. RyoAtemi says it's fine for Swift-Sama to share the Omniscience reports and pretend to be Omniscience. They agree that Mega is just making things up. Bedna asks for healing.
Seventeen refuses to tattoo Drasky but says if they were allies he might tattoo him. Drasky asks Seventeen who he needs dead. No reply.
TempelJaeger (initiate) asks DarkLight if they could teach him stuff. DarkLight refuses as he has prior commitments. TempelJaeger asks DarkLight if he knows who King might be. DarkLight says he can't help with finding who is the King, but mentions he's okay with TempelJaeger muling for him, but realizes he would have needed to send the credits earlier for that to work.
TempelJaeger asks Mega if they would teach him Circuit II (for combat purposes). Mega refuses as he has prior commitments, but mentions he might do that during the night.
TempelJaeger (initiate) asks Swift-Sama what DarkLight is teaching and if he's worth checking out. Mentions that Teyao is "what one would expect" (hinting at Water 1). No reply.
Teyao asks TempelJaeger if he would like to learn. TempelJaeger agrees, but Teyao says something else came up.
Witherbrine gloats about not having been hurt to Paradosi. Paradosi shares that trading would have displeased a God, which Witherbrine accepts.
