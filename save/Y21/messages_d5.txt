DarkLight asks Seventeen in his conversation why he gave a Recursion Rune to HypoSoc. No reply.
DarkLight asks Swift-Sama for Omniscience information. No reply.
Darkpiplumon complains to Drasky that they didn't attack with them. Drasky points out that they misread the conversation. Oops.
Darkpiplumon remarks to PocketRikimaru in the Economics Club that this was a weird choice of attack. PocketRikimaru explains he forgot to read the day reports (sadly true). Darkpiplumon floats the idea of interrupting SWift-Sama and DarkLight. Teyao says he might start attacking. Darkpiplumon says he has, but there's Sabotage and everyone bunkers.
Drasky asks Anemone what they need to do to not trigger God for trades. Anemone says (again) that they need to keep at least 1 credit after their trade has concluded.
Drasky tries extorting PocketRikimaru, who refuses (he wants a Liquid Memory for him killing the Market Connection guy who gave him the information on PocketRikimaru). PocketRikimaru offers 2 credits to kill the Market Connection guy. Drasky thinks PocketRikimaru has 3 credits.
HypoSoc remarks to Drasky that there's a lot of Combat Regen this game. Shares his "displease a god" message for trading. Drasky says he's gonna go kill PocketRikimaru. HypoSoc warns about Ablative Ossification. Says he's gonna attack a Combat Regen player. Asks if Drasky has access to Petrification, Drasky says no. HypoSoc says Paradosi will get Congealing Will. Asks if Drasky can break statues. Drasky says yes if he can get a sword or a fire rune. HypoSoc says he can get a fire rune. Drasky asks for more info on the trade HypoSoc tried to do, HypoSoc says credits to Paradosi for muling. Drasky asks about PocketRikimaru's build, HypoSoc says Concept 1 Gold, likely Lucrative.
HypoSoc asks Teyao if their trade was interrupted. Teyao miss-submited his vote because of a copy paste. They submit the trade again, HypoSoc warns Teyao that the Divine aero can stop trades from happening.
Mega tells HypoSoc that he doesn't want to waste his day turns on DarkLight again. HypoSoc offers an extra credit for them to keep attacking. Mega doesn't want to do that during the day, but is okay to do it at night. HypoSoc doesn't need night blocking, he needs day blocking (and class blocking in particular).
Paradosi tells HypoSoc he didn't receive any credit. HypoSoc shares that his trade was blocked by the Divine aero. Paradosi shares that he's Patient. HypoSoc asks if he has any way to deal with DarkLight and Swift-Sama. Paradosi says he could grab congealing will. HypoSoc says it would be very useful.
Swift-Sama tells Drasky that he was rude. Drasky doesn't think it was.
Swift-Sama remarks in RyoAtemi's chat that the night events were an interesting developement, asks RyoAtemi if there's anything he CAN do since RyoAtemi provides a lot of information for free. RyoAtemi is chill about it and is vibing. Shares the Omniscience report. Bedna remarks that Seventeen is an altruist. Asks for what they could grab with Patient to teach the group (like MF2, Psyops...). Asks if they know any other Patient player that they could Fall. RyoAtemi says MF2, copycat, and psyops are all interesting. Bedna thinks that copycat isn't good enough given the time left.
TempelJaeger says something uncomprehensible to Witherbrine.
