He does respect the spite play though. 
RyoAtemi shares the omniscience report. Swift-Sama asks if RyoAtemi can help him dodge Mega.

They agree to not use bombs yet and wait to see if bombs detonate in the future, as if 1 detonate they can still detonate theirs on D8+. HypoSoc says he'll attack RyoAtemi. HypoSoc convinces Drasky to work with him since it doesn't cost him much to do so. HypoSoc is trying to engineer a situation where enough Chronoshift bombs explode to send him back in the past before he was fucked.
