DarkLight tells Drasky about Witherbrine having a frankly unreasonable amount of progress, as they trained circuit 2 on day 1 but runecrafted on day 3.
DarkLight doesn't get why Mega is still stalling him. Mega says it's still business, which means anything and nothing.
DarkLight asks Seventeen to be taught MA1. They agree.
Darkpiplumon (initiate) asks DragonLord for targets. DragonLord wants to finish off Bedna, but could be convinced to change. Darkpiplumon is fine with Bedna dying and will try to attack someone else.
Darkpiplumon asks Drasky for targets. Darkpiplumon tells him that HypoSoc told him that PocketRikimaru was GOLD Concept 1, Bedna's weak, and RyoAtemi is unknown. Drasky says he can't help tonight but might be able to get someone else to also attack RyoAtemi. Darkpiplumon says he'll attack RyoAtemi.
Darkpiplumon asks HypoSoc for targets. He cites PocketRikimaru, Bedna, and RyoAtemi (weasel, weak, and no info). HypoSoc says PocketRikimaru's build is Concept I + Gold. Darkpiplumon doesn't want to attack PocketRikimaru as they shopped last turn.
Darkpiplumon asks Mega for targets. Suggests PocketRikimaru is a good target. Mega says he's already fucking up someone with Patient tonight.
Drasky tells Anemone he doesn't believe that the aeromancy that randomly stops trades and makes people wander only does that, and that it must have some big payout. Asks Anemone to warn them when they trigger whatever the Aeromancy might do at higher levels.
Drasky threatens PocketRikimaru with the knowledge that they appear to have somehow bought three liquid memories (what). PocketRikimaru is cool as a cucumber and unphased by this.
Drasky asks Seventeen if they have a target for tonight, Seventeen doesn't. Drasky suggests RyoAtemi or Bedna, or possibly interrupting Teyao. Drasky says he has someone attacking RyoAtemi already (not Mega) if Seventeen wants to double up. Says Bedna dies anyway since DragonLord is on them.
HypoSoc tells Drasky that Swift-Sama tattooing themselves indicates that they are not Omniscience (there couldn't possibly be an Aeromancy that lets people tattoo themselves). Shares that Bedna has Profiling and Aero Intuition, asks Drasky if they wanna hit Swift-Sama. They agree. HypoSoc mentions having made an Oath to not attack them until they were three players left, but blah blah blah, clever rationalization as to why they broke the Oath. They're Oathbreaker. Shares that Teyao wants Venom, asks if it's fine to give it to them. Drasky says that shouldn't be an issue. Drasky wonders if they should learn who the Patient players are to take care of them or send Mega their way, HypoSoc discloses Mega is already attacking a Patient player. Drasky says something incomprehensible, mentions that if they can get Seventeen/Paradosi to attack someone, they can send DarkLight to them as well. HypoSoc says he'll try. Later asks about what Drasky shopped for, to see if there was any items that are banned by the divine aero. Drasky says it cannot be true, as his second attempt at shopping contained everything from his first attempt. This disproves HypoSoc's theory.
HypoSoc asks Seventeen if they gave Swift-Sama Recursion (it's something they should have asked like 7 turns ago). Asks if Seventeen plans to attack. Seventeen says that Witherbrine and Swift-Sama shouldn't have the progress to do either, and that they only gave their runes to HypoSoc and DarkLight, who shouldn't have been able to use them because of the constant interruptions. HypoSoc says there's been a teaching ring and that Witherbrine is Earth II. Seventeen says that DarkLight must have traded his rune to Swift-Sama, but that it doesn't explain Witherbrine. (This is immensely sus, btw. It could also be the opposite happening: maybe DarkLight traded his rune to WITHERBRINE, and that doesn't explain Swift-Sama. Someone observant might notice that you seem very sure that Swift-Sama got one of your Recursion runes...). HypoSoc mentions that DarkLight is 1000% allied with Swift-Sama.
NinetyNineLies tells HypoSoc that the enemy of their enemies isn't their friend, and that he's confident in his own ability to beat them. HypoSoc tells him that if he has information worth more than 0.5 credits, he should try and sell him on it.
Paradosi tells HypoSoc he wasn't expecting him to go to class. HypoSoc says you can go pretty far with 0 combat. Paradosi asks if HypoSoc is making Aeromancy runes, and that it would be funny if HypoSoc was King. HypoSoc states that he isn't a global Aeromancer. HypoSoc asks Paradosi if he's attacking tonight, states that PocketRikimaru is a good target. Paradosi notes that he isn't, as he's just shopped, and DragonLord didn't manage to damage Pocket. Paradosi asks what HypoSoc wants him to mule. HypoSoc doesn't know yet, but asks for a Synthetic Weave as a default.
PocketRikimaru is satisfied with DragonLord's groveling.
Seventeen asks in DarkLight's chat how Swift-Sama plans to explain the broad daylight tattooing. Swift-Sama says if they don't talk about it people might just forget. DarkLight complains about Mega being fixated about them. Swift-Sama says it's because they don't want DarkLight teaching him Combat Regen, or gaining altruist progress in general. Seventeen asks for a Rune. DarkLight doesn't understand why, if people don't want Swift-Sama having Combat Regen, they don't just kill them. Swift-Sama says that: "He wants the option to kill me, not to actually kill me. I'm useful for information." (NB: he's talking about HypoSoc here, not Mega, even though Swift-Sama is unaware of this.)
Swift-Sama asks Drasky to stab PocketRikimaru as he shopped for 3 Liquid Memories at the store. Drasky asks for PocketRikimaru's full build. Swift-Sama says he has GOLD and MF1 for sure, trained MA2, and likely has AC1 as they purchased a bokken, plus they trained a LOT.
Swift-Sama says he'd need 2 credits to get HypoSoc 2 reports, as spending credits is hard. HypoSoc doesn't have that. HypoSoc asks for the N5 instead when Swift-Sama gets it.
TempelJaeger asks Seventeen if he's the one that causes people to "craft weird stuff". No reply.
TempelJaeger points out that Swift-Sama's position isn't tenable. Asks for information or cooperation in killing people that are defenseless.
TempelJaeger and Witherbrine talk to each other. TempelJaeger isn't God. Witherbrine is Void, which apparently does nearly nothing.
Teyao asks Bedna in the RyoAtemi's convo whether they need healing. They do. RyoAtemi shares the Omniscience report. No further discussion takes place.
Teyao invites Darkpiplumon to the Economics Club. Darkpiplumon accepts.
Teyao creates the economics club with Darkpiplumon and PocketRikimaru. Their goal is to coordinate for information and get the fighters to start killing King and God. He has a knowledge bomb for everyone: Sabotage is in play.
Teyao asks HypoSoc if he can send him a venom tonight for a credit. HypoSoc accepts.
Teyao (initiate) asks Mega if they've ever considered teaching, asks to be taught Circuit III for 3 credits. Mega is obviously interested but needs to fuck over a Patient player today, and asks if this can wait. Teyao is okay with waiting.
Teyao (initiate) invites PocketRikimaru to the Economics Club. PocketRikimaru accepts.
Teyao asks RyoAtemi if he wants to learn more. RyoAtemi doesn't mind if Teyao doesn't need to heal Bedna.
