BlackLemonAde asks Darkpiplumon how their game is going. Non-ideally is the answer. BlackLemonAde thinks the game is boring because slow academic grind.
BlackLemonAde asks Teyao how the game is going. "Likely to devolve into an academics race", replies Teyao.
DragonLord asks DarkLight if they need healing, they don't. DarkLight reports that their trades are still blocked.
Drasky tells Anemone he'd like a Shrooms to get anti-geo.
Drasky tells HypoSoc the Venom helped, asks for a replacement. HypoSoc asks if they're up to attack RyoAtemi or PocketRikimaru, confirms they have sabotage (Mega should have died). Drasky points out that Teyao and Coledon are the most likely culprits for Chronoshift Bombs. HypoSoc says they might have to go to class and kill someone at night, but wonders if Drasky can interrupt someone since they have 2A already. Drasky says he'll consider it (LMAO). HypoSoc says they're stopping spite interruption from Mega by telling them they don't intend on killing them, as they aren't the priority target. HypoSoc asks Drasky if maybe they can both buy a Chronoshift Bomb and take the game back to a time when they both were the only ones with Academics. Drasky isn't confident there's no illusionists nor secret academics. HypoSoc says Omniscience probably stops illusionists, and that the danger is that today's classgoers might have MF2 and win outright, so going back further enough would work better than matching them. Drasky asks HypoSoc how many credits they have. Their entire plan relies on the assumption that whoever had bombs has 2 more. Drasky tells HypoSoc how Styx works, and that he's down to do the time warp thing. HypoSoc has 7 credits, so they figure they can shop. All is well.
HypoSoc tells TempelJaeger Aab means Anemone (oops). TempelJaeger tells HypoSoc that Coledon went missing. HypoSoc thinks it's unlikely to have anything to do with number 3. TempelJaeger wonders if Darkpiplumon is a fighter, HypoSoc says they attacked once to no success. HypoSoc says this comes from Hotmonkey and Swift-Sama, and that NNL confirmed that Darkpiplumon is Chameleon. TempelJaeger says it's unlikely he's able to buy both lots of Chronoshift bombs and get enough academics to beat Drasky, so the best he can get is 2nd place. Says they should die during the night to be sure. Adds that DragonLord is asking them for goals during the day.
Mega complains to HypoSoc that PR/Darkpiplumon were better targets. HypoSoc says he needed Armor Break to kill PocketRikimaru. Tells Mega he hasn't got any plan to kill him, though, as he doesn't have the time.
Mega complains in the clusterfuck conversation, tells PocketRikimaru that HypoSoc is going for armor break. Darkpiplumon posts their report, which shows Coledon being. Darkpiplumon shares that the King message comes from the KING aeromancy, and that DragonLord is likely Savior (beam of light).
NinetyNineLies asks HypoSoc if Drasky is Split. HypoSoc says they are, and claimed it was worse than a Lizard Tail.
Paradosi tells Drasky he didn't see his muling request.
RyoAtemi shares with his group his report, but RyoAtemi is alone. No one replies.
RyoAtemi tells TempelJaeger they don't think they can win, TempelJaeger says it probably depends on when the last day is.
Seventeen asks HypoSoc who they should attack between Drasky and Mega. They've seemingly given up, because they believe they cannot win an Academics race. HypoSoc says Mega or RyoAtemi, as Drasky has a Lizard Tail ability. HypoSoc says if there wasn't X or King they might have been able to win together. Tragic.
TempelJaeger asks DragonLord what they're trying to achieve. DragonLord has no idea. TempelJaeger says they should try going to class during the day (it's been noted to help winning) and kill people during the night (same). TempelJaeger says they won't do anything exciting. DragonLord would like to kill someone. Offers to heal TempelJaeger if they're injured. TempelJaeger says they don't need healing, and they prefer being closer to death, but that they were warped and that it's an issue. TempelJaeger suggests targets (Anemone, Coledon, Mega...), or even the other fighters. DragonLord says he's not much better than the other fighters, but that Anemone sounds like a fine target.
TempelJaeger asks Seventeen if they used the Bomb and wonders if their aeromancy lets them reuse items. Seventeen says it's not even close to right. TempelJaeger wonders if it might be some kind of mirror of Halt. Seventeen says it's an even worse guess.
